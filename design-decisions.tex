\todo{Jim}

We investigate the following design questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item easy/expert mode or standard/advanced more
    \item multi-threadable
    \item data structure for representing a graph/matrix
    \item error handling
    \item opacity of LAGraph
    \item how to work around typecasting being expensive in GraphBLAS
    \item terminology: properties (parameters? features?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we introduced the LAGraph library, the rationale behind our design,  
and a performance baseline based on the GAP benchmark suite.   We also introduced
a notation for graph algorithms expressed in terms of linear algebra.  We hope this
notation will lead to a consensus-notation the 
larger ``Graphs as Linear Algebra'' community might adopt.

This paper defines the foundation for our future work on the LAGraph project.  
We plan to explore Python wrappers for LAGraph that work well for data analytics workflows.  
In addition to the GAP benchmarks, which focus on graph algorithms, we will  
investigate end-to-end workflows based on the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/IosupHNHPMCCSAT16}.

Algorithmically we see a number of research directions to pursue.   With end-to-end workflows, the performance
of data ingestion heavily impacts performance.  We are interested in improving data ingestion performance
by exploiting a CPU's SIMD instructions~\cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/LangdaleL19}.  We are also interested in how  
LAGraph maps onto GPUs using versions of the GraphBLAS optimized for GPUs.

\section{Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}

GAP algorithms: BFS, SSSP, TC, BC, PR. Not sure whether CC should be included.

\subsection{BFS}

push/pull~\cite{DBLP:conf/icpp/YangBO18}

GraphBLAST stores both directions and picks automatically~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1908-01407}

\subsection{Betweenness Centrality}

also does push/pull

\subsection{PageRank}

% The PR in GAP does not work well if there are dangling vertices in the graph.
% The Graphalytics benchmark has a PageRank variant which avoids this problem~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-15028}.

\subsection{SSSP}

\subsection{Triangle Count}

(Not too interesting from an API design point of view.)

\subsection{Connected Components}

Needs a few GxB extensions.
